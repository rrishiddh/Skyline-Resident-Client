## Project Name: Skyline Resident

### A brief description: 
- Skyline Resident is a comprehensive building management platform designed to streamline the management and operations of a residential building. The system supports three user roles—Admin, Member, and User—each with distinct access levels and functionalities.
 


---

### Purpose:

- The purpose of the Skyline Resident project is to create an efficient, user-friendly platform for managing residential buildings by streamlining tenant interactions, administrative tasks, and resource allocation, fostering seamless collaboration between administrators, members and users. The Admin Dashboard empowers administrators to efficiently manage members, review agreement requests, and handle coupon creation. Admins can also make important announcements and oversee the entire building management process. The Member Dashboard provides members with access to rent payments, payment history, and announcements, ensuring seamless tenant interactions. Users, on the other hand, can explore available apartments and submit agreement requests for desired units.
  



### Main Key Features:

1. User Roles: Role-specific dashboards for Admin, Member and User- each tailored to their specific needs.

2. Apartment Listings: A searchable, paginated list of available apartments with detailed information, such as floor number, block name, rent, and more.

3. Agreement Management: Users can submit agreement requests, while admins can review and approve or reject them.

4. Payment System: Members can securely make rent payments with coupon code discounts and view their payment history.

5. Coupon Management: Admins can create, update, and manage coupon codes for rent discounts.

6. Announcements: Admins can post important announcements, visible to all members and users.

7. Authentication System: Secure login and registration with email and password, including social authentication (Google).

8. Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing.

9. Data Security: Sensitive configurations and credentials are secured using environment variables.

10. Interactive User Experience: Intuitive navigation, Framer Motion animations, and sweet alerts for feedback on user actions.
